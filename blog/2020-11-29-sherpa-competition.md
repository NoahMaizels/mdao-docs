# New UNI OMV2/ETH Staking Poolü§ëüî•



Dear Sherpas,

We are happy to announce the release of the updated UNI OM-V2/ETH Liquidity Provider (‚ÄòLP‚Äô) token staking pool!

This pool will provide a further incentive and an avenue for Sherpas to ‚Äúliquidity mine‚Äù OM tokens by providing liquidity to the OM-V2/ETH Uniswap pool and staking the corresponding UNI-V2 LP tokens. The details of the pool are as follows:

- **Asset:** UNI-V2 OM-V2/ETH LP tokens;

- **How to Obtain UNI-V2 OM-V2/ETH LP tokens:** You can obtain these by first adding liquidity to the [OM/ETH Uniswap pair ](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xe46935aE80E05cdEbD4a4008B6ccaA36d2845370)by following this [link](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3593d125a4f7849a1b059e64f4517a86dd60c95d&outputCurrency=ETH). Once you have successfully provided liquidity there, your address will be credited with [UNI-V2 OM/ETH LP tokens](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe46935aE80E05cdEbD4a4008B6ccaA36d2845370), which you can then stake in the corresponding newly released pool on the MANTRA DAO platform.

- **OM-V2 Token Rewards:** There will be no fixed APR for this pool. Instead, a set amount of 2 OM per block applicable from now till block no. 11862000 which is approximately 15 February 2021. These will be distributed amongst stakers in the MANTRA DAO UNI OM-V2/ETH pool on the [MANTRA DAO platform](https://app.mantradao.com/), proportional to their staking contribution to the pool.

- **OM Reward Accrual Terms:** Rewards are accrued on a per block basis, and become available to be claimed immediately upon being accrued.

- **Claiming OM Reward Balance: **Users can claim rewards at any time, and doing so will kick-off an 8-day unstaking timer, after which the staking reward tokens become available for withdrawal.

**Unstaking Staked UNI OM-V2/ETH LP token balance:** Users can unstake and immediately withdraw their UNI OM-V2/ETH LP token staked balance at any time. There will be no time-lock or unstaking timer for this, and thus the user‚Äôs tokens will be withdrawn immediately.
