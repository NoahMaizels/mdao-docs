# OM Token V2 — Circulating Supply Emission Schedule (Update — December 18th, 2020)

Over the last 4 months since our OM Token Generating Event (TGE) in August 2020, the MANTRA DAO team has been on a mission to be completely transparent every step of the way. As we move our current OM token to a new enhanced V2 OM token, we continue to remain on course with this commitment. We are hereby publishing our updated transparency report so that it may serve our community as a guide for the economics of the OM token emission schedule and circulating supply. To understand the full details of our OM Token V2 upgrade, please study our OM V2 launch article here.

Now, without further ado, let’s get started!

We trust the above information is helpful for our community in staying up to date with the specific details around MANTRA DAO’s updated token emission schedule! At MANTRA DAO we are committed to keeping our community well informed and to be as transparent as possible. It is our hope that as we grow and expand we will continue to inform our community as much as possible on important milestones and provide the necessary information that will help us communicate effectively with our community.
